## gitodo report

View activity report

### Synopsis


View the activity report for a given period of time that displays repositories,
projects/branches, completed items, added but not completed items, and
recorded time if any.

The command can be executed anywhere, it is not required to be within a git
repository.

The command takes one argument that represents the number of days to look back
for the data since the moment of requesting the report. Default value is 1.

If flags --from and --to are provided, the "days" argument is ignored and the 
given interval is used instead. Both flags must be provided.

To limit the report only to git repositories under a certain directory (child
directories included), use the --dir flag. Relative paths are supported.

To get the report in a JSON format that also contains more details than the
default screen, set the --json flag. This flag, together with --from and --to
can be used for automation scripts i.e. a cron job to feed the external systems
(like time tracking or project management software) with the recorded data.
When exporting to JSON, every timestamp will be converted to UTC.
