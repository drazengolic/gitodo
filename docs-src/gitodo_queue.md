## gitodo queue

Add to-do items to the repository queue

### Synopsis


Add to-do items to the repository queue.

Queue is not an active to-do list, but a list of things you'd like to take on
later, perhaps in another branch.

Invoking without arguments will open up the editor for multiple items to be 
added. If there are arguments, all of them will be joined into a single to-do
item.

```
gitodo queue [flags]
```

### Options

```
  -h, --help   help for queue
```
