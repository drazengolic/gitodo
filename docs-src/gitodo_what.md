## gitodo what

Display what's next to do

### Synopsis


Display the first to-do item that isn't completed yet, starting from the top

If there is no such item, "All done!" message will be shown.

If there is a timer running, it will display the session time at the moment of
the command execution. Also, if there are stashed changes assigned to any of
the to-do items in the repository, the full list will be printed, organized by
the branch name.
