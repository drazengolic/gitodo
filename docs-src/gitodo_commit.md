## gitodo commit

Run a git commit with a prepared message

### Synopsis


Run "git commit" with a prepared message based on the completed to-do items
that will also be marked as committed if the commit was successful.

Items that are previously marked as committed will not be included in the 
message unless "--amend" flag is provided.

By default, the command will execute "git commit -eF msgfile", and any 
additional arguments or flags passed to this command will be appended to the
base command.

Special flag handling:

 - if "--amend" flag is passed to commit, the msgfile will contain all of the
   completed to-do items that either aren't flagged as committed, or they were
   flagged as committed in the previously executed commit.

 - if "--no-edit" is passed together with "--amend", no message will be 
   generated and "-eF" will be left out
