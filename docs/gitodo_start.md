## gitodo start

Start a timer for the active branch

### Synopsis


Start a timer for the active branch. Where possible, an OS notification will
be displayed.

If the timer is already running, an error will be displayed.

NOTE: only one timer can be active at any point in time! If a timer is active,
and you try to make changes on a repository/branch other than the one that
timer is running for, you'll have to stop it before you proceed with the 
changes. Only "queue" command is allowed.

```
gitodo start [flags]
```

### Options

```
  -h, --help   help for start
```
