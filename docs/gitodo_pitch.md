## gitodo pitch

Checkout branch and add items at one go

### Synopsis


Quickly checkout to a branch (or create a new one if it doesn't exist) and add
to-do items via arguments, or with an editor if no item arguments are provided.

If --base flag is not provided, the current branch will be used as a starting
point for the new branch.

If --stash is provided, any changes will be stashed before checking out. When
there is an active to-do item, the stash will reference the item.

Project name can be also set by setting the --name flag.

```
gitodo pitch branch_name [items...] [flags]
```

### Options

```
  -b, --base string   Starting point (base) for the new branch
  -h, --help          help for pitch
  -n, --name string   Project name
  -s, --stash         Stash changes before checkout
```
