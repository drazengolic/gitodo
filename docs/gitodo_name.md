## gitodo name

Display or set the name for your to-do branch.

### Synopsis


Display or set the name for your to-do branch.

The name defaults to the active branch. If a custom name is set (i.e. the 
title of a board ticket), it will be displayed across the application along
with the branch name.

When no argument is given, the command will output the current name.

If there are arguments provided, the first one will be used to set the project
name (no text join will happen, so make sure to use quotes).

```
gitodo name [name] [flags]
```

### Options

```
  -h, --help   help for name
```
